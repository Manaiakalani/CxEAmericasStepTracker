# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CACHE FIX PATCH

## Problem
Users are experiencing cached content issues where they have to create a new user on each page refresh. The app is loading from localStorage before Supabase data is available.

## Root Cause
1. `loadCurrentUser()` is called during `init()` before Supabase data is loaded
2. `this.users` array is empty when `loadCurrentUser()` runs
3. App falls back to localStorage data instead of fresh Supabase data

## Quick Fix
Force Supabase data loading before any user selection logic.

## Files to Patch
- `script.js` - Main application initialization logic
- `live-display/display.js` - Live display loading logic

## Impact
- âœ… Always uses fresh Supabase data
- âœ… Eliminates localStorage cache issues  
- âœ… Ensures users don't need to re-register
- âœ… Maintains all existing functionality
