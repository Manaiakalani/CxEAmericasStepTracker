# The Stomp Feature - CxE Americas Step Tracker

## Overview

"The Stomp" is a new feature added to the live dashboard that displays the **aggregate number of steps from all attendees** during the entire CxE Americas Offsite period. This metric showcases the collective power and activity level of all participants, creating a sense of team unity and shared achievement.

## Feature Description

### What is "The Stomp"?

"The Stomp" is a compact widget that displays:
- **Total aggregate steps** from all participants across the entire offsite period
- **Compact horizontal layout** positioned below the main stats and above the activity feed
- **Clean visual design** without distracting animations
- **Real-time updates** every 30 seconds alongside other dashboard metrics

### Visual Design

The feature is implemented as a compact widget between the stats cards and activity feed:

- **Gradient background** using Microsoft's brand colors (blue, purple, teal)
- **Horizontal layout** with icon, title, large number, and label
- **Subtle animations** including:
  - Gentle hover effects
  - Scale animation on updates
- **Clean design** without flashing or distracting elements
- **Responsive design** that adapts to mobile (vertical layout on small screens)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`live-display/index.html`**
   - Added compact "stomp-widget" positioned between stats and activity feed
   - Horizontal layout with icon, title, number, and label

2. **`live-display/styles.css`**
   - Added compact CSS for horizontal widget layout
   - Removed flashing animations and shimmer effects
   - Mobile-responsive with vertical layout for small screens

3. **`live-display/display.js`**
   - Added `totalOffsiteSteps` calculation that sums ALL steps from ALL days for ALL users
   - Added simplified `updateStompDisplay()` function
   - Integrated with existing data refresh cycle

### Data Calculation

The aggregate steps calculation:

```javascript
const totalOffsiteSteps = users.reduce((sum, user) => {
    let userTotalSteps = 0;
    if (user.steps && typeof user.steps === 'object') {
        Object.values(user.steps).forEach(dailySteps => {
            if (typeof dailySteps === 'number' && dailySteps > 0) {
                userTotalSteps += dailySteps;
            }
        });
    }
    return sum + userTotalSteps;
}, 0);
```

### Dynamic Messaging

The widget provides a clean, consistent display of the aggregate step count without distracting milestone messages, maintaining focus on the core metric.

## User Experience
